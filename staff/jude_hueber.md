Jude Hueber is the Principal Engineer and Owner of JKV Engineering LLC, a company that specializes in automotive and power systems engineering. 

He became interested in systems engineering while taking mechatronics and controls courses at Colorado State University where he received a B.S. Mechanical Engineering in 2006.

Jude then started his career designing robotic equipment for nuclear decommissioning and decontamination work at SA Robotics.  During that time, each project that he was involved with had equal parts mechanical design, electrical or hydraulic design, and control systems work.   This experience with whole systems engineering allowed Jude and JKV to tackle larger projects in automotive power-train systems.
